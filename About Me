Greetings all! My name is Christopher Rodriguez and I am glad you came to visit me. 
Allow me to let you in on a little of who I am. 
I was born, raised, and currently live in Wichita,Kansas USA. 
I grew up playing baseball and was fortunate enough to make into a semi-professional Mexican League
in my years after High School. When that dream passed on, I joined the United States Air Force and am 
still currently serving. I have deployed twice into combat regions in the Middle-East and am thankful to be
home here in the USA! Now I find myself ready to transition into a new and exciting career.
-Cheers!
